# SQL_Projects


The essence of our project is to let the executives and supervisors know about the losses incurred by the company because of returns made by the customer. During the evaluation, it was found that there were some discrepancies in the data, so an assumption was made. The project involves findings as follows:


• Month-wise profit for Category and Region

• Month-wise comparison of profits

• Profit and Quantity sold by Month and category

• Profit and Quantity sold by quarter and category

• Quantity of return orders/profit

• Top 10 most and least sold profit

• Profit by Shipping mode

• Profit by Segment and Category

• Yearly city-wise churn rate of customers

All these observations will let the stakeholders take appropriate measures to improve the current working system, moreover, increasing the profits and revenue.
